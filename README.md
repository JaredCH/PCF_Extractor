# PCF_Extractor
Extract Bill of Material from PCF's


This program can be used to process PCF files that in the past have always required a licensed version of the ISOGEN engine, either in the form of Spoolgen or other similar softwares. The Deliverable will be a Bill of Material's Report, containing all items that exist within the PCF file, includeing a Qty / length of said items.


The goal is to be able to feed the software a PCF file, and have an excel BOM generated, requireing no user manipulation to be able to easily identify materials, descriptions, specs, qty's / lengths, as well as any other needed information.
